## Running

The first step is to clone the project and install dependencies
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

This step will install the project dependencies.

Now you need to setup the environment variables.
For that check out the [Create-React-App Docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) and the [Env Sample File](./.env.sample).

To generate Marvel API keys, do you need to create an account and follow the docs. [More Information](https://developer.marvel.com/docs)

After this configuration you can run the following command:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To run the automated tests:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
